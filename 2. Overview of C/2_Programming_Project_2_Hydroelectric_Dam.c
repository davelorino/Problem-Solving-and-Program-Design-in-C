/* Write a program to assist the design of a hydroelectric dam. Prompt the user for the height of the dam and for the number of cubic meters of water  
 * that are projected to flow from the top to the bottom of the dam of each second. 
 * Predict how many megawatts (1MW = 10^6W) of power will be produced if 90% of the work done on the water by gravity is converted to electrical energy.
 * Note that the mass of one cubic meter of water is 1000kg.
 * Use 9.80 m/sec^2 as the gravitational constant G.
 * Be sure to use meaningful names for both the gravitational constant and the 90% efficiency constant.
 * For one run, use a height of 170 m and flow of 1.30 x 10^3/s.
 * The relevant formula (w = work, m = mass, g = gravity, and h = height) is: 
 * w = mgh.
